# Bank-Marekting-Classification
With a background in finance and as a typical American user, this study piqued my interest!  We are looking at data from a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns. Most potential subscribers needed several phone calls to decide whether they had subscribed to the featured product. The commodity in question is a term deposit, which is a cash investment kept at a financial institution at a fixed interest rate for a specified period of time.  We will build a classification model to accurately evaluate binary consumer activity (yes — subscribed or no — did not subscribe). The bank could then use the same model to forecast consumer reactions to potential marketing initiatives.
